missing_260_subfields.xml, missing_260_subfields.mrc -

  This record is based off of several that were produced from a
  long pipeline of transformations, starting with a relational
  database and ending in MARC.  I've replaced the text of the
  fields to help protect the identity of the actual source. I've
  also removed some other issues so that this record can be an
  example of just the missing subfields. I've included both the
  final record produced (.mrc) and the second to last step, (.xml).
  The .mrc file was produced by:

  yaz-marcdump -i marcxml -o marc missing_260_subfields.xml > missing_260_subfield.mrc

  The issue is that the data field 260 has no subfields. The cause is
  a step using XSLT that converts the record from MODS to MARCXML.
  The template in question:
     a) matches on a particular element type
     b) creates the datafield 260
     c) creates different subfields depending on certain attributes.

  However, our MODS does not have any of the attributes used in step c)
  so no subfields get created.  The MODS at this point has a
  non-standard attribute, most likely by mistake earlier in the pipeline.
  When trying to modify the pipeline, the invalid MARCXML caused issues.
